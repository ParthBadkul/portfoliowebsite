              Social Walli is an app I built that lets anyone share their
              thoughts in a public space. Itâ€™s a simple, interactive social wall
              where people can post messages, ideas, or anything they want to
              say. The goal is to create a space where everyone feels free to
              express themselves. This project highlights my ability to design
              and develop user-friendly, community-focused applications.

              I developed Fashoff, a fashion app created with Flutter, where I
              handled both the UI/UX design and the development. The app has a
              sleek, modern interface designed for a seamless and stylish
              shopping experience. By blending elegant design with
              functionality, Fashoff offers users smooth navigation while
              exploring fashion products. This project showcases my expertise in
              both design and cross-platform development using Flutter.

              This project is a minimalist and efficient login interface built
              using Flutter and powered by Google Firebase. It offers secure
              authentication with real-time validation and smooth animations.
              The design is clean and user-centric, featuring seamless login
              experiences for various authentication methods, including
              email/password and social logins.
