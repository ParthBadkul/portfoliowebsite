            Social Walli is an app I built that lets anyone share their thoughts
            in a public space. Itâ€™s a simple, interactive social wall where
            people can post messages, ideas, or anything they want to say. The
            goal is to create a space where everyone feels free to express
            themselves. This project highlights my ability to design and develop
            user-friendly, community-focused applications.

            I developed Fashoff, a fashion app created with Flutter, where I
            handled both the UI/UX design and the development. The app has a
            sleek, modern interface designed for a seamless and stylish shopping
            experience. By blending elegant design with functionality, Fashoff
            offers users smooth navigation while exploring fashion products.
            This project showcases my expertise in both design and
            cross-platform development using Flutter.

            This project is a minimalist and efficient login interface built
            using Flutter and powered by Google Firebase. It offers secure
            authentication with real-time validation and smooth animations. The
            design is clean and user-centric, featuring seamless login
            experiences for various authentication methods, including
            email/password and social logins.
